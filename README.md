## 📘 Project Overview

NaiveRAG is a fully operational Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system designed to answer complex queries using content extracted from PDF documents.

The system processes files through a structured sequence of independent modules:

* **PDF Parsing** → Converts uploaded files into structured text.
* **Text Chunking** → Splits long documents into overlapping segments for semantic processing.
* **Vectorization & Indexing** → Transforms chunks into searchable embeddings.
* **Query Matching** → Identifies the most relevant chunks per query.
* **Answer Generation** → Produces clear, contextually grounded responses.

Each step is modular, testable, and interchangeable, making the architecture ideal for both experimentation and real-world extension.

## 🔧 Customization & Integration Potential

NaiveRAG is built for flexibility and integration. Each stage—ingestion, segmentation, indexing, retrieval, generation—can be adapted independently to fit client-specific environments.

Whether integrating into internal knowledge bases, exposing as an API, or embedding into existing tools and dashboards, the architecture supports seamless deployment. It's suitable for private cloud, on-premise, and containerized workflows.
